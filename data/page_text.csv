Modes,Overview,The Regional Transportation Plan was designed to meet the central Puget Sound region’s current transportation needs and to prepare for the future. Commute Mode share from the American Community Survey is an important tool to help track how travel is changing as the region grows.
Modes,Modes-Region,"Travel to work has been changing for decades. For years, driving alone to work had been the dominant mode of travel in the Puget Sound region. In recent years, extensive transit expansion, changes in growth patterns and enhanced Transportation Demand Management (TDM) strategies have slowly been reducing the share of driving alone to work, especially in the region's major employment centers. The COVID-19 pandemic changed travel to work rapidly and the region is still slowly re-adjusting to a ""new-normal"".<h2>Drove Alone</h2>Driving alone to work varies across the region but it continues to be the highest share of travel to work. Between 2006 and 2019, driving alone accounted for almost 70% of all work trips. The share of driving alone has been slowly dropping since 2010 and was significantly affected by the global pandemic. Although driving alone has increased since 2020 pandemic lows, it was still below 60% in 2022.<h2>Work from Home</h2> In 2022, approximately 25% of people worked from home in the region, down from pandemic highs closer to 30% but still above the regional average of around 6% pre-pandemic. <h2>Transit</h2>Use of transit to work had steadily climbed from about 7% of work trips in 2006 to almost 11% by 2019. The pandemic affected transit travel with many workers in downtown settings more able to work from home."
Modes,Modes-Wages,The average wage earned for a worker who works from home is significantly higher than people using other travel modes in 2022.
Modes,Modes-Race,People of color tend to work from home less frequently than white workers.
Modes,Modes-AAPI,"The AAPI community is not monolithic, and the experiences of AAPI residents in the central Puget Sound region are diverse. Different factors may relate to who does and does not commute to work in specific modes. The differences for commute modes are likely, in part, due to how immigration and history has shaped different AAPI populations in this region. There is a diversity of backgrounds and circumstances, including refugees escaping very challenging situations, immigrants with highly specialized and sought-after skills, and families with  multiple generations of history in the region. Different communities under the AAPI umbrella may face different barriers and have different employment opportunities that affect the manner in which they commute for work."
Modes,Modes-Occupation,Management jobs are more likely to work from home
