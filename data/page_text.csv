Modes,Overview,The Regional Transportation Plan was designed to meet the central Puget Sound region’s current transportation needs and to prepare for the future. Commute Mode share from the American Community Survey is an important tool to help track how travel is changing as the region grows.
Modes,Modes-Region,"In 2022, approximately 25% of people worked from home in the region, down from pandemic highs closer to 30% but still above the regional average of around 6% pre-pandemic. All travel modes continue to be below pre-pandemic levels."
Modes,Modes-Wages,The average wage earned for a worker who works from home is significantly higher than people using other travel modes in 2022.
Modes,Modes-Race,People of color tend to work from home less frequently than white workers.
Modes,Modes-AAPI,"The AAPI community is not monolithic, and the experiences of AAPI residents in the central Puget Sound region are diverse. Different factors may relate to who does and does not commute to work in specific modes. The differences for commute modes are likely, in part, due to how immigration and history has shaped different AAPI populations in this region. There is a diversity of backgrounds and circumstances, including refugees escaping very challenging situations, immigrants with highly specialized and sought-after skills, and families with  multiple generations of history in the region. Different communities under the AAPI umbrella may face different barriers and have different employment opportunities that affect the manner in which they commute for work."
Modes,Modes-Occupation,Management jobs are more likely to work from home
